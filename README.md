## Description
I was tasked with creating a webpage that shows different weather conditions based off of a user's input in the search field. The inputted city's temperature, wind speed, and humidity are displayed after entering a city.

I was supposed to add a 5-day forecast listing the same values, but I havent finished that part yet.

## Installation
1. Download or clone repository
2. Open the main page (index.html) on your browser to view webpage
3. Use a text editor to view all coding.
   

## Usage
Once the webpage is loaded up the user will need to type in a city name into the search bar and click "search". After doing so, the weather values will list on the page.
